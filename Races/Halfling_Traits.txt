~~~Halfling~~~
The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. They appear harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. Some halflings live quiet and peaceful lives in remote agricultural communities, while others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples.
