~~~Human~~~
Short-lived but influential far beyond their years, humans have rapidly spread across the worlds of D&D. Most are the descendants of pioneers, conquerors, traders, travelers, refugees, and others on the move. As a result, human lands are home to a mix of people—physically, culturally, religiously, and politically diverse. Hardy or fine, light-­‐skinned or dark, showy or austere, primitive or civilized, devout or impious, humans run the gamut.
