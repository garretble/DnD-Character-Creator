~~~Dwarf~~~
Many ages have passed since the dwarven kingdoms commanded the world. Their mightiest strongholds, delved into misty mountains, have long since fallen into shadow’s hands. The magnificent walls now lie in rubble, shattered by giants’ boulders and invaders’ siege engines. Where once dwarf miners tunneled through rock and toiled at the forges, now orcs and goblins roam. The fabulous riches for which they are famed have been plundered by enemies from below. And yet, the dwarves remain. They remember their ancient glories. And they cravevengeance against the enemies who brought them low.The world knows dwarves for their skill in battle, their ability to withstand physical and magical punishment, and their knowledge of the earth’s secrets. They are as renowned for their hard work as for their ability to quaff large quantities of ale. Their ancient and mysterious kingdoms, carved into the hearts of mountains, are famed for their marvelous treasures.
